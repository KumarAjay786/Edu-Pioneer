                      <span class="ep-highlight-text">India</span> India has made a colossal progress in terms of education and the literacy rate that has increased
                      over the years. The primary education has helped pave way for a concrete foundation for all
                      students and consequently it has led to the great economic development as well. The credit for
                      education boom is certainly attributed to the Government of India that provides funding for it on
                      various levels. However, despite the fact that India has a very large education sector, there was a
                      need for an absolute and inclusive platform that shared information regarding everything
                      related to various education options.
                  </p>
                  <p class="ep-main-text">
                    The biggest problem faced by students for so many years was the lack of useful or genuine
                    information regarding different institutions, because either there are so many or there are very
                    few institutes. Nevertheless, all students tussle analyzing various options available to them and
                    picking the right one for them because there isn’t a platform in Indian education system that
                    offers outright comprehensive information, insights and criteria that complements and suffices
                    the very minute doubts or requirements of a parent, a child, a youth or an adult who wants to
                    garner more information and authentic data about the available options.

                  students face a lot of difficulty in getting accurate and

                  provider. Not only does Education Pioneer brings about
                  the best of all the available educational options in India, it
                  also acts as a true mentor in helping you know more about

                <h3 class="au-subheading">Our Vission</h3>
                <p class="justipy_eql_text">Education in India has rapidly improved over the years, with a significant progress to  make education accessible for all. As a matter of fact, in ancient times education has
                    always been considered crucial for an individual's growth and it remains the same today
                    as well, the only difference is it has become more imperative and competitive today.
                    Education Pioneer channelizes its vital and visionary goal of becoming the global
                    education service provider as well as becoming a solo platform for different professional
                    education services. Apart from this, our vision is to enhance the education quality and the
                    education system in India by bridging the gap between students and educational
                    institutions. The best way to accomplish all these visions is by making Education Pioneer
                    an accessible portal for all to reach, anywhere, anytime.</p>
